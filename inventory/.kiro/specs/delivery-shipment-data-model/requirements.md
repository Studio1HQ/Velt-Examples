# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the existing inventory management data model to include delivery and shipment tracking context, enabling warehouse and logistics teams to collaborate on shipment delays and fulfillment issues. The transformation will extend the current inventory-focused data structure to support delivery tracking, ETA management, and shipment status monitoring while maintaining the existing table functionality and comment system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a logistics team member, I want to view shipment data alongside inventory information, so that I can track deliveries and identify potential fulfillment issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the data grid THEN the system SHALL display shipment-related fields including ShipmentID, DeliveryStatus, ETA, and DelayReason
2. WHEN viewing inventory items THEN the system SHALL recontextualize existing fields for delivery tracking purposes
3. WHEN displaying product information THEN the system SHALL maintain existing fields but present them in a shipment context
4. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL include both inventory and delivery information for each record

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a warehouse manager, I want to see delivery status indicators that reflect shipment conditions, so that I can quickly identify delayed or problematic shipments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing delivery status THEN the system SHALL display "On Time", "Delayed", "Fulfillment Issue" instead of stock status
2. WHEN a shipment is delayed THEN the system SHALL show delay reasons and estimated resolution time
3. WHEN there are fulfillment issues THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic shipments with appropriate visual indicators
4. WHEN viewing status indicators THEN they SHALL maintain semantic color coding (green for on-time, yellow for delayed, red for issues)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a logistics coordinator, I want to track estimated delivery dates and actual delivery performance, so that I can manage customer expectations and identify process improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing shipment records THEN the system SHALL display original ETA and current estimated delivery date
2. WHEN a delivery is delayed THEN the system SHALL show the delay duration and updated ETA
3. WHEN tracking delivery performance THEN the system SHALL indicate whether shipments are ahead of, on, or behind schedule
4. WHEN viewing delivery dates THEN they SHALL be formatted consistently and show relative time information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a fulfillment team member, I want to see shipment quantities and fulfillment status, so that I can understand inventory allocation and shipping capacity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing shipment data THEN the system SHALL show quantities being shipped, available inventory, and allocation status
2. WHEN there are inventory constraints THEN the system SHALL indicate partial fulfillment or backorder situations
3. WHEN viewing fulfillment information THEN the system SHALL show relationship between inventory levels and shipment capacity
4. WHEN tracking shipments THEN the system SHALL display fulfillment priority and urgency indicators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to add contextual comments about delivery issues and delays, so that the team can collaborate on resolving shipment problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN commenting on shipment records THEN the system SHALL maintain existing Velt comment functionality
2. WHEN viewing comments THEN they SHALL be contextually relevant to delivery and fulfillment issues
3. WHEN discussing shipment problems THEN team members SHALL be able to comment on specific delivery aspects
4. WHEN collaborating on issues THEN the comment system SHALL support delivery-focused discussions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the data transformation to maintain backward compatibility, so that existing functionality continues to work while adding delivery context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the new data model THEN existing table functionality SHALL remain intact
2. WHEN adding delivery fields THEN the system SHALL not break current comment integration
3. WHEN transforming data THEN existing UI components SHALL continue to function properly
4. WHEN updating the data structure THEN performance SHALL not be negatively impacted
