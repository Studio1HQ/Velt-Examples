# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement comprehensive dark mode styling for the inventory management application, with particular focus on the table component and other remaining UI elements that currently lack dark mode support. The implementation will provide a cohesive dark theme experience across all components while maintaining accessibility and visual hierarchy.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want all components to have proper dark mode styling, so that I can use the application comfortably in low-light environments without visual inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is active THEN all components SHALL display with appropriate dark theme colors
2. WHEN switching between light and dark modes THEN all visual elements SHALL maintain proper contrast ratios for accessibility
3. WHEN viewing any component in dark mode THEN text SHALL remain clearly readable against dark backgrounds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the inventory table to have proper dark mode styling, so that I can easily read and interact with inventory data in dark environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the inventory table in dark mode THEN the table background SHALL use dark colors
2. WHEN viewing table rows in dark mode THEN alternating row colors SHALL provide clear visual separation
3. WHEN hovering over table rows in dark mode THEN hover states SHALL be clearly visible
4. WHEN viewing table headers in dark mode THEN they SHALL have distinct styling from table body
5. WHEN viewing status indicators in the table THEN they SHALL maintain their semantic meaning with appropriate dark mode colors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent dark mode styling across all UI components, so that the application feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is active THEN buttons SHALL use appropriate dark theme colors
2. WHEN dark mode is active THEN form inputs SHALL have dark backgrounds with proper contrast
3. WHEN dark mode is active THEN cards and containers SHALL use consistent dark color schemes
4. WHEN dark mode is active THEN icons and graphics SHALL adapt to the dark theme
5. WHEN dark mode is active THEN borders and dividers SHALL be visible but subtle

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want interactive elements to have proper dark mode hover and focus states, so that I can easily navigate and interact with the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hovering over interactive elements in dark mode THEN they SHALL provide clear visual feedback
2. WHEN focusing on form elements in dark mode THEN focus indicators SHALL be clearly visible
3. WHEN clicking buttons in dark mode THEN active states SHALL be appropriately styled
4. WHEN interacting with dropdown menus in dark mode THEN they SHALL have proper dark styling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the dark mode implementation to follow CSS best practices, so that the code is maintainable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing dark mode styles THEN CSS custom properties SHALL be used for color management
2. WHEN adding dark mode styles THEN they SHALL be organized in a maintainable structure
3. WHEN applying dark mode THEN existing component functionality SHALL not be affected
4. WHEN viewing the application THEN there SHALL be no visual glitches during theme transitions
