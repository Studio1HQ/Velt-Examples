# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enable users to resize table columns by dragging column borders, allowing them to adjust column widths to view complete content that may be truncated due to insufficient column width. This addresses the common issue where important data like timestamps, long text, or numerical values are cut off in table displays.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing tabular data, I want to resize table columns by dragging their borders, so that I can adjust column widths to see complete content that is currently truncated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over a column border THEN the system SHALL display a resize cursor (col-resize)
2. WHEN a user clicks and drags a column border THEN the system SHALL dynamically adjust the column width in real-time
3. WHEN a user releases the mouse button after dragging THEN the system SHALL maintain the new column width
4. WHEN a column is resized THEN the system SHALL ensure the table layout remains functional and other columns adjust appropriately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want column widths to have reasonable minimum and maximum constraints, so that the table remains usable and doesn't break the layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to resize a column below a minimum width THEN the system SHALL prevent the column from becoming smaller than 80px
2. WHEN a user attempts to resize a column beyond the table container THEN the system SHALL limit the maximum width to maintain table boundaries
3. WHEN a column reaches its minimum width THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback that further resizing is not possible
4. WHEN the total table width exceeds the container THEN the system SHALL enable horizontal scrolling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my column width preferences to persist during my session, so that I don't have to readjust columns every time I navigate or refresh the data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user resizes columns THEN the system SHALL store the column widths in session storage
2. WHEN a user refreshes the page or navigates back to the table THEN the system SHALL restore the previously set column widths
3. WHEN a user clears their browser session THEN the system SHALL revert to default column widths
4. IF no previous column widths exist THEN the system SHALL use intelligent default widths based on content type

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the column resizing to work on both desktop and touch devices, so that I can adjust columns regardless of my input method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on a desktop device THEN the system SHALL support mouse-based column resizing
2. WHEN a user is on a touch device THEN the system SHALL support touch-based column resizing with appropriate touch targets
3. WHEN a user is resizing on touch devices THEN the system SHALL provide adequate touch target size (minimum 44px) for column borders
4. WHEN resizing on any device THEN the system SHALL provide smooth visual feedback during the resize operation
