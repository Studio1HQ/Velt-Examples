# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive README documentation that showcases the development process using Kiro IDE, including the combination of libraries used, detailed prompts given to Kiro, and visual demonstrations through screenshots. The updated README will serve as both project documentation and a tutorial/blog-style guide demonstrating AI-assisted development workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer or blog reader, I want to see a detailed overview of the libraries and technologies used in this project, so that I can understand the technical stack and dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the README THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive "Tech Stack" section listing all major libraries and frameworks
2. WHEN viewing the tech stack THEN the system SHALL include brief descriptions of each library's purpose in the project
3. WHEN viewing the tech stack THEN the system SHALL organize libraries by category (UI, Styling, Development Tools, etc.)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer interested in AI-assisted development, I want to see how Kiro IDE was used in this project, so that I can understand the AI development workflow and tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the README THEN the system SHALL include a dedicated "Development with Kiro IDE" section
2. WHEN viewing the Kiro section THEN the system SHALL explain what Kiro IDE is and its role in the project
3. WHEN viewing the Kiro section THEN the system SHALL include 1-2 example prompts that were actually used during development
4. WHEN viewing the prompts THEN the system SHALL show both the prompt input and a brief description of the resulting output

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visual learner reading a tutorial, I want to see screenshots of the IDE and development process, so that I can better understand the workflow and tools being demonstrated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the README THEN the system SHALL include relevant screenshots from Kiro IDE showing the development process
2. WHEN viewing screenshots THEN the system SHALL include captions explaining what each image demonstrates
3. WHEN viewing the tutorial content THEN the system SHALL format screenshots appropriately for blog/tutorial consumption
4. IF screenshots show prompts THEN the system SHALL ensure the prompts are clearly visible and readable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer following this as a tutorial, I want the README to be structured as a comprehensive guide, so that I can follow along and understand both the project and the development methodology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the README THEN the system SHALL maintain a logical flow from project overview to technical details to development process
2. WHEN reading the tutorial sections THEN the system SHALL include clear headings and subheadings for easy navigation
3. WHEN viewing code examples or prompts THEN the system SHALL use proper markdown formatting for readability
4. WHEN viewing the document THEN the system SHALL include a table of contents or clear section organization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As someone interested in the project's development history, I want to understand the specific prompts and AI interactions that shaped the codebase, so that I can learn from the AI-assisted development approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the README THEN the system SHALL include a "Prompt Examples" section with real prompts used during development
2. WHEN viewing prompt examples THEN the system SHALL include context about what each prompt accomplished
3. WHEN viewing AI interactions THEN the system SHALL explain the iterative process of working with Kiro
4. IF showing prompt results THEN the system SHALL highlight key outcomes or code changes that resulted

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a reader of the blog/tutorial, I want the README to maintain the existing project setup information while adding the new tutorial content, so that the document serves both as project documentation and educational content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the README THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing "Getting Started" and deployment information
2. WHEN viewing the enhanced README THEN the system SHALL integrate new tutorial content without disrupting existing functionality instructions
3. WHEN following setup instructions THEN the system SHALL ensure all original Next.js setup steps remain accurate and accessible
4. WHEN viewing the document structure THEN the system SHALL organize content so both project users and tutorial readers can find relevant information easily
