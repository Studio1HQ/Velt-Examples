## 🤖 Built with Kiro AI IDE

This entire project was developed using **Kiro AI IDE**, showcasing how AI-assisted development can accelerate complex application building while maintaining code quality and best practices.

### 🎯 Key Kiro Prompts Used

#### Initial Project Setup
```
Create a collaborative inventory management dashboard with the following requirements:

SUMMARY: A simple dashboard showing inventory data and allowing internal discussion on stock issues and fulfillment problems.

KEY FEATURES:
- Data grid with inventory items, status, stock levels
- Detail view for each record  
- Comments on specific items with @tag mentions
- Reactions and sidebar filter for discussions
- Focus on inventory management rather than shipment tracking

TECH STACK:
- TanStack Table for data grid
- Next.js with TypeScript
- Velt comments and notifications for collaboration
- Modern UI with responsive design

USE CASE: Shows how warehouse and logistics teams can comment on low stock items, supplier issues, and inventory problems collaboratively. Team members should be able to @mention each other (like @steve @elli) to coordinate restocking and resolve inventory issues.

Make it professional and production-ready with proper error handling and TypeScript compliance.
```

#### UI Enhancement Prompt
```
Remove Discussions and reactions section from side bar 
make UI attractive
remove these blue colors looks overwhelming make rest components shorter and professional here
make stock threshold components little color full cant see entire close and edit buttons
```
