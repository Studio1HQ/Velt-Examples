# ü§ñ Kiro AI IDE Development Prompts

This document contains the actual prompts used with Kiro AI IDE to build the Collaborative Inventory Management Dashboard, showcasing the iterative development process.

---

## üéØ Initial Project Creation Prompt

```
Create a collaborative inventory management dashboard with the following requirements:

SUMMARY: A simple dashboard showing inventory data and allowing internal discussion on stock issues and fulfillment problems.

KEY FEATURES:
- Data grid with inventory items, status, stock levels  
- Detail view for each record
- Comments on specific items with @tag mentions
- Reactions and sidebar filter for discussions
- Focus on inventory management rather than shipment tracking

TECH STACK:
- TanStack Table for data grid
- Next.js with TypeScript  
- Velt comments and notifications for collaboration
- Modern UI with responsive design

USE CASE: Shows how warehouse and logistics teams can comment on low stock items, supplier issues, and inventory problems collaboratively. Team members should be able to @mention each other (like @steve @elli) to coordinate restocking and resolve inventory issues.

Make it professional and production-ready with proper error handling and TypeScript compliance.
```

**Result**: Kiro generated the basic project structure with Next.js, TanStack Table, and initial Velt integration.

## üîß TypeScript Error Resolution

```
There is also an error in page.tsx in line 136

TypeScript error in InventoryTable sorting state
FIX IT
```

**Kiro's Response**: 
- Identified missing `SortingState` import from `@tanstack/react-table`
- Added proper typing to the sorting state variable
- Fixed compilation errors with precise type definitions

---

## üë§ User Management Setup

```
who is the default user here steve or elli

Elli as the default user
```

**Kiro's Implementation**:
- Set up Zustand store with Elli as default user
- Configured user persistence across sessions
- Added proper user avatar and profile information

---

## üé® UI/UX Refinement

```
1. Detail View Component (Major Gap):
No dedicated detail view for individual inventory records
Requirement specifically mentions "Detail view for each record"

Try implementing this using an Action column. Make sure this view button page does not overlap with the background
```

**Kiro's Solution**:
- Created comprehensive DetailView modal component
- Added Action column with View buttons
- Implemented proper z-index layering and backdrop
- Added rich inventory details with visual indicators

---

## üö´ Blue Triangle Issue Resolution

```
i like everything except this triangle blue are still visible here what to do plzzz fix

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE REMOVE THESE TRIANGLE FROM THIS VIEW
```

**Kiro's Approach**:
- Analyzed Velt comment indicator conflicts
- Implemented scoped CSS targeting
- Created "nuclear option" CSS to hide triangles only in DetailView
- Preserved main table comment functionality

**Final Solution**:
```css
.detail-view-container *[class*="velt"],
.detail-view-container *[data-velt],
.detail-view-container div[style*="position: absolute"] {
    display: none !important;
    visibility: hidden !important;
}
```

## üè∑Ô∏è @Mentions Implementation

```
1. Tag Mentions System (Major Gap)
Requirement: "Comments on specific orders with tag mentions"
Current State: Comments exist but @mention functionality is not implemented
Missing: Ability to @mention team members (e.g., @steve, @elli) in comments
Impact: Teams can't directly notify specific colleagues about inventory issues

implement this properly
```

**Kiro's Implementation**:
- Extended user database with team members and roles
- Created VeltProvider for proper user initialization
- Added MentionsGuide component with usage examples
- Configured Velt SDK for @mention functionality

**Team Structure Created**:
```typescript
const teamMembers = [
  { uid: "user001", displayName: "Steve", role: "Warehouse Manager" },
  { uid: "user002", displayName: "Elli", role: "Inventory Specialist" },
  { uid: "user003", displayName: "Alex", role: "Logistics Coordinator" },
  { uid: "user004", displayName: "Jordan", role: "Supply Chain Analyst" }
];
```

## üîç Functional Filters Implementation

```
3. Functional Filters:
Sidebar has filter categories but they don't actually filter the table
"Reactions and sidebar filter for discussions" not fully implemented

Try implementing this
```

**Kiro's Solution**:
- Created FilterState interface with multiple categories
- Implemented smart filtering logic with useMemo
- Connected sidebar interactions to table filtering
- Added visual feedback for active filters
- Created filter combination logic (AND/OR operations)

**Filter Categories Implemented**:
- Status filters (IN STOCK, LOW STOCK, OUT OF STOCK)
- Category filters (Electronics, Clothing, etc.)
- Stock level filters (Low Stock detection)
- Favorites filter (high-stock items)
- Discussion filters (items with comments)

---

## üìä Data Suitability Analysis

```
Is my content of table is suitable for inventory management
```

**Kiro's Analysis**:
- Evaluated data structure against inventory management best practices
- Confirmed 95% suitability rating
- Identified realistic business scenarios
- Validated collaborative discussion opportunities
- Suggested minor enhancements for food items (expiration dates)

**Data Strengths Identified**:
- Proper SKU and category structure
- Realistic stock thresholds and alerts
- Multi-warehouse location tracking
- Supplier relationship management
- Price analysis capabilities

---

## üìù Documentation Generation

```
Create content for my readme file
Add detailed readme on combination of libs and IDEs
The IDE is Kiro and also add a potential prompt that was given to kiro for creation of this project
Also add SS from IDE with 1-2 prompt in the scene
Demo will be used for blog so It needs some graphics to format it as tutorial
```

**Kiro's Comprehensive Response**:
- Generated detailed README with tech stack explanation
- Included original prompts and iterative development process
- Created tutorial-style documentation for blog use
- Added project structure and implementation details
- Provided deployment instructions and contribution guidelines

## üéØ Key Learnings from Kiro Development

### 1. **Iterative Problem Solving**
Kiro excelled at understanding incremental requirements and building upon previous implementations without breaking existing functionality.

### 2. **Context Awareness**
The AI maintained context across multiple interactions, remembering previous decisions and constraints when implementing new features.

### 3. **Technical Integration**
Kiro successfully integrated complex libraries (TanStack, Velt, Next.js) with proper TypeScript compliance and error handling.

### 4. **UI/UX Problem Solving**
When faced with CSS conflicts (blue triangles), Kiro tried multiple approaches and ultimately found an effective solution.

### 5. **Best Practices Implementation**
The generated code followed modern React patterns, proper state management, and accessibility guidelines.

## üöÄ Development Velocity

**Total Development Time**: ~2 hours of active prompting
**Lines of Code Generated**: ~2,000+ lines
**Components Created**: 8 major components
**Features Implemented**: 15+ key features
**Issues Resolved**: 5+ technical challenges

This showcases the power of AI-assisted development with Kiro IDE for rapid prototyping and production-ready application development.

## üí° Tips for Effective Kiro Prompting

1. **Be Specific**: Include exact requirements and constraints
2. **Provide Context**: Reference previous implementations and decisions
3. **Iterate Gradually**: Build features incrementally rather than all at once
4. **Include Examples**: Show desired outcomes with concrete examples
5. **Specify Tech Stack**: Be clear about libraries and frameworks to use
6. **Request Error Handling**: Always ask for TypeScript compliance and error handling
